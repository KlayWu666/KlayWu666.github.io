#### Biography
I am a 2023 graduate Student from the school of computer science and technology, Southeast University.

My research interests lie in Computer Vision and their application in diverse practical scenarios, such as biological and automatic driving. My focus also extends to Large Multimodal Models(LMMS) and Efficient Machine Learning , leveraging expertise in high-performance computing and distributed systems.

From 2019 to 2023, I studied at Southeast University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I was honored to attend join [WANG's LAB](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0105/c23024a257533/pagem.htm) starting from August 2020, where my focus was on traditional machine learning and object detection. I thank Mr. Wang very much for his guidance though I did not perform well in his lab. From 2022, I began my graduate project *Design and implementation of detection model for automatic driving* under the guidance of Professor [Yi Zhou](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2023/1024/c23024a469551/page.htm).


I am passionate about open source and firmly believe in its potential to disseminate knowledge widely, leverage technology to lead innovation to the world and contribute to the advancement of human society. I have personally gained valuable knowledge from the open-source community. I am gradually expanding [my github projects](https://github.com/KlayWu666?tab=repositories), and I believe that open-source projects will benefit numerous individuals.
